Higher-order abstract syntax incorporates name binding information in a uniform and language generic way. Thus it acts as a powerful link integrating diverse tools in such formal environments. We have implemented higher-order abstract syntax, a supporting matching and unification algorithm, and some clients in Common Lisp in the framework of the Ergo project at Carnegie Mellon University.},

We then study the resulting categories of algebras for several theories. Our principal result is that there exists a cofibrantly generated Quillen model structure on the category of 1-truncated Martin-Löf complexes and that this category is Quillen equivalent to the category of groupoids. In particular, 1-truncated Martin-Löf complexes are a model of homotopy 1-types.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose four axioms that a quasicategory should satisfy to be considered a
reasonable homotopy theory of {$(\infty,n)$}-categories. This axiomatization
requires that a homotopy theory of {$(\infty,n)$}- categories, when equipped with
a small amount of extra structure, satisfies a simple, yet surprising,
universal property. We further prove that the space of such quasicategories is
homotopy equivalent to {$(RP^\infty)^n$}. In particular, any two such
quasicategories are equivalent. This generalizes a theorem of To\"en when n =
1, and it verifies two conjectures of Simpson. We also provide a large class of
examples of models satisfying our axioms, including those of Joyal, Kan, Lurie,
Rezk, and Simpson.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we give a summary of the comparisons between different definitions of so-called (∞, 1)-categories, which are considered to be models for ∞-categories whose n-morphisms are all invertible for n > 1. They are also, from the viewpoint of homotopy theory, models for the homotopy theory of homotopy theories. The four different structures, all of which are equivalent, are simplicial categories, Segal categories, complete Segal spaces, and quasi-categories.},

  Abstract                 = {{In most major universities one of the three or four basic first-year graduate mathematics courses is algebraic topology. This introductory text is suitable for use in a course on the subject or for self-study, featuring broad coverage and a readable exposition, with many examples and exercises. The four main chapters present the basics: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature is the inclusion of many optional topics not usually part of a first course due to time constraints: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and Steenrod squares and powers.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Dependent type theories have a long history of being used for theorem proving. One aspect of type theory which makes it very powerful as a proof language is that it mixes deduction with computation. This also makes type theory a good candidate for programming—the strength of the type system allows properties of programs to be stated and established, and the computational properties provide semantics for the programs. This thesis is concerned with bridging the gap between the theoretical presentations of type theory and the requirements on a practical program- ming language. Although there are many challenging research problems left to solve before we have an industrial scale programming language based on type theory, this thesis takes us a good step along the way. In functional programming languages pattern matching provides a concise notation for deﬁning functions. In dependent type theory, pattern matching becomes even more powerful, in that inspecting the value of a particular term can reveal information about the types and values of other terms. In this thesis we give a type checking algorithm for definitions by pattern matching in type theory, supporting overlapping patterns, and pattern matching on intermediate results using the with rule. Traditional presentations of type theory suffers from rather verbose notation, cluttering programs and proofs with, for instance, explicit type information. One solution to this problem is to allow terms that can be inferred automatically to be omitted. This is usually implemented by inserting metavariables in place of the omitted terms and using unification to solve these metavariables during type checking. We present a type checking algorithm for a theory with metavariables and prove its soundness independent of whether the metavariables are solved or not. In any programming language it is important to be able to structure large programs into separate units or modules and limit the interaction between these modules. In this thesis we present a simple, but powerful module sys- tem for a dependently typed language. The main focus of the module system is to manage the name space of a program, and an important characteristic is a clear separation between the module system and the type checker, making it largely independent of the underlying language. As a side track, not directly related to the use of type theory for pro- gramming, we present a connection between type theory and a ﬁrst-order logic theorem prover. This connection saves the user the burden of prov- ing simple, but tedious ﬁrst-order theorems by leaving them for the prover. We use a transparent translation to ﬁrst-order logic which makes the proofs constructed by the theorem prover human readable. The soundness of the connection is established by a general metatheorem. Finally we put our work into practise in the implementation of a programming language, Agda, based on type theory. As an illustrating example we show how to program a simple certified prover for equations in a commutative monoid, which can be used internally in Agda. Much more impressive examples have been done by others, showing that the ideas developed in this thesis are viable in practise.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This advanced textbook on topology has three unusual features. First, the introduction is from the locale viewpoint, motivated by the logic of finite observations: this provides a more direct approach than the traditional one based on abstracting properties of open sets in the real line. Second, the author freely exploits the methods of locale theory. Third, there is substantial discussion of some computer science applications. As computer scientists become more aware of the mathematical foundations of their discipline, it is appropriate that such topics are presented in a form of direct relevance and applicability. This book goes some way towards bridging the gap for computer scientists.}},

    abstract = {A comprehension category is defined as a functor P:E→B→ satisfying (a) a cod ∘ P is a fibration, and (b) f is cartesian in E implies that Pf is a pullback in B. This notion captures many structures which are used to describe type dependency (like display-map categories (Taylor (1986), Hyland and Pitts (1989) and Lamarche (1988)), categories with attributes (Cartmell (1978) and Moggi (1991)), D-categories (Ehrhard (1988)) and comprehensive fibrations (Pavlović (1990)). It also captures comprehension as occurring in topos theory and as described by Lawvere's (1970)) hyperdoctrines. This paper is meant as an introduction to these comprehension categories. A comprehension category will be called closed if it has appropriate dependent products and sums. A few examples of closed comprehension categories will be described here; more of them may be found in Jacobs (1991); applications occur in Jacobs (1991) and Jacobs et al. (1991). },

	abstract = {Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types represent categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on equipping each type with both a notion of path and a separate notion of directed morphism. In this setting, a directed analogue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions---a higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In this paper, we give a constructive model of a directed type theory with directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos, following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical techniques used to give computational models of homotopy type theory, we show that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations, with a partial directed univalence principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphisms in this universe. To complete this retraction into an equivalence, we refine the universe of covariant fibrations using the constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch.},

We present a mechanized proof of a result called the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem, which relates the higher-dimensional loop structures of two spaces sharing a common part (represented by a pushout type, which is a generalization of a disjoint sum type) to those of the common part itself. This theorem gives important information about the pushout type, and has a number of useful corollaries, including the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which was used in previous formalizations. The proof is more direct than existing ones that apply in general category-theoretic settings for homotopy theory, and its mechanization is concise and high-level, due to novel combinations of ideas from homotopy theory and from type theory.},

	abstract = {Type theories with equality reflection, such as extensional type theory (ETT), are convenient theories in which to formalise mathematics, as they make it possible to consider provably equal terms as convertible. Although type-checking is undecidable in this context, variants of ETT have been implemented, for example in NuPRL and more recently in Andromeda. The actual objects that can be checked are not proof-terms, but derivations of proof-terms. This suggests that any derivation of ETT can be translated into a typecheckable proof term of intensional type theory (ITT). However, this result, investigated categorically by Hofmann in 1995, and 10 years later more syntactically by Oury, has never given rise to an effective translation. In this paper, we provide the first effective syntactical translation from ETT to ITT with uniqueness of identity proofs and functional extensionality. This translation has been defined and proven correct in Coq and yields an executable plugin that translates a derivation in ETT into an actual Coq typing judgment. Additionally, we show how this result is extended in the context of homotopy type theory to a two-level type theory.},

abstract = {We use type-theoretic techniques to present an algebraic theory of ∞-categories with strict units. Starting with a known type-theoretic presentation of fully weak ∞-categories, in which terms denote valid operations, we extend the theory with a non-trivial definitional equality. This forces some operations to coincide strictly in any model, yielding the strict unit behaviour. We make a detailed investigation of the meta-theoretic properties of this theory. We give a reduction relation that generates definitional equality, and prove that it is confluent and terminating, thus yielding the first decision procedure for equality in a strictly-unital setting. Moreover, we show that our definitional equality relation identifies all terms in a disc context, providing a point comparison with a previously proposed definition of strictly unital ∞-category. We also prove a conservativity result, showing that every operation of the strictly unital theory indeed arises from a valid operation in the fully weak theory. From this, we infer that strict unitality is a property of an ∞-category rather than additional structure.},

MTT is parametrized by a mode theory which specifies a collection of modes, modalities, and transformations between them. We show that different choices of mode theory allow us to use the same type theory to compute and reason in many modal situations, including guarded recursion, axiomatic cohesion, and parametric quantification. We reproduce examples from prior work in guarded recursion and axiomatic cohesion --- demonstrating that MTT constitutes a simple and usable syntax whose instantiations intuitively correspond to previous handcrafted modal type theories. In some cases, instantiating MTT to a particular situation unearths a previously unknown type theory that improves upon prior systems. Finally, we investigate the metatheory of MTT. We prove the consistency of MTT and establish canonicity through an extension of recent type-theoretic gluing techniques. These results hold irrespective of the choice of mode theory, and thus apply to a wide variety of modal situations.},
