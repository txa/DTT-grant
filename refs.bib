  Abstract        = {Financial and insurance contracts do not sound like promising
                    territory for functional programming and formal semantics, but in
                    fact we have discovered that insights from programming languages
                    bear directly on the complex subject of describing and valuing a
                    large class of contracts.We introduce a combinator library that
                    allows us to describe such contracts precisely, and a compositional
                    denotational semantics that says what such contracts are worth. We
                    sketch an implementation of our combinator library in Haskell.
                    Interestingly, lazy evaluation plays a crucial role.},
