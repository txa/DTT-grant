### TEAM STATEMENT (section 5) BEGIN ###

The project leadership team consists of Thorsten Altenkirch (Professor of Computer Science), Ulrik Buchholtz (Assistant Professor of Computer Science), and Nicolai Kraus (Royal Society University Research Fellow and Professor of Theoretical Computer Science). In addition, our team comprises one full-time PDRA and nine project partners.

The proposal requires expertise in several different subfields and we, the leadership team, bring exactly this diverse blend of complementary skills to the project. Altenkirch has long standing experience in the syntax and semantics of dependent type theories, Buchholtz is a leading expert in synthetic approaches to mathematics, and Kraus specialises on constructive higher structures. Our project partners are leading experts in their respective subfields and have a track record of successful collaborations with us. In the following, we discuss each of the four R4RI modules in detail.

MODULE 1 – Contributions to the generation of new ideas, tools, methodologies or knowledge

We and our project collaborators have a long history of successful collaborations which led to many joint publications. The Functional Programming Lab at the University of Nottingham, co-chaired by Altenkirch (PI/lead), is one of the internationally leading groups in the field of type theory. Altenkirch's main research interests are type theory, functional programming, categorical methods and quantum computing. He has published over 80 papers in these areas which are frequently cited (h-index 39). Similarly, Buchholtz and Kraus (co-leads) very frequently publish at leading venues in theoretical computer Science such as the flagship and CORE A*-rated conference LICS (logic in computer science), where, earlier this year, we received distinguished paper awards for two separate papers, providing a recent example of how our team's work is recognised at the highest levels in the wider field. For his contributions to homotopy type theory, Kraus further received the Ackermann Award 2016. 

Module 2 – The development of others and maintenance of effective working relationships 

We have ample experience leading research projects. Altenkirch served as the PI on on four EPSRC projects including *Homotopy Type Theory: Programming and Verification* as well as the US Airforce grant *Certified Programming with Dependent Types*. Kraus holds a University Research Fellowship, the Royal Society's 8-year flagship fellowship for early career researchers, and an ERC Consolidator grant (Translations between Type Theories). In total, the leadership team has secured funding for XY postdoctoral researchers (XY years), and [co-] supervised XY PhD students to completion.

We have a huge network of international collaborations all over the world, including our carefully selected project partners. Altenkirch holds a visiting position (?) at Eötvös Loránd University. We are individually frequently invited to participate at major research meetings at centres including IAS Princeton, IHP Paris, Hausdorff Institute Bonn, Schloss Dagstuhl, CIRM Luminy, and CAS Oslo.

Module 3 – Contributions to the wider research and innovation community 

We have given numerous invited talks (in 2025 at BCTCS, [todo: good examples]), served on program committees at leading conferences in theoretical computer science (including POPL in 2017 and FSCD as well as LICS in 2025 [todo: examples]), and acted as opponents at many international PhD defences (in 2025, in Stockholm and Budapest [todo examples]). We are particularly actively involved in the TYPES community, where Altenkirch (PI/lead) further served on the management committee for the COST action EUTYPES (CA15123), and is currently involved in the COST action EuroProofNet (CA20111). Altenkirch and Kraus participated in the special year on Univalent Foundations at the IAS Princeton (2012/13) and contributed to the HoTT Book [todo: cite]. Altenkirch frequently reaches out to the philosophy community and has given invited talks at XY. We further contribute to the development of Agda by providing regular feedback (??) and teach Lean to our undergraduates.

Our group is one of the founding members of the Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science (MGS), a spring school for PhD students, early career researchers, and industry participants that has been running annually since 1999. In recent years, MGS always attracts more than one hundred in-person participants. We both organise (most recently, 2022 and 2026??) and lecture (every year) at MGS. This allows us to reach interested people who are not yet members of our wider community, and places us in a perfect position to recruit PhD students and the PDRA requested as part of this application.

Module 4 – Contributions to broader research/innovation-users and audiences and towards wider societal benefit

Although we work in a deeply foundational field where direct societal impact may not be expected, we work hard on reaching out to non-experts and interested members of the public. One major medium for this is *Computerphile*, a popular YouTube channel with 2.3M subscribers that aims to explain computer science, programming, and related topics in an accessible way. Altenkirch has contributed XY videos, several of which have breached 1M views and explain a selection of type-theoretic topics.

While the spring school MGS focusses on theory it has, as discussed above, regularly a significant number of industry participants (around 10-20 per year) and attracts sponsoring from Meta, Huawei, todo-XYXY. This is unsurprising considering that type-theoretic methods are used in the most security-critical contexts. The perhaps most well-known example is Google's Chrome browser, where the encryption algorithm was extracted from Rocq (todo-add-citation-in-references). Agda is very prominent in the work by Input Output, and XYXY use type theoretic methods in order to TODO.

A final example of reaching out to the public is the HoTTeST summer school (where Buchholz lectured), an event that attracted around 2,000 participants whose sole motivation was to get to know some homotopy type theory and get in touch with the wider community. While some participants were students of homotopy type theory, many more were interested laypeople.
