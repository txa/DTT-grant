**Foundations of Directed Type Theory: Bridging Category Theory and Homotopy Type Theory**

*Summary*

Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) has transformed type theory and formal reasoning, providing a powerful language for the mechanised foundations of mathematics and computer science. A cornerstone of HoTT is the univalence axiom, which equates isomorphic structures—capturing the abstract nature of types. However, HoTT fundamentally relies on *symmetry*; it treats equivalences, not general morphisms, as primitive.

We propose a new foundation: **Directed Type Theory (DTT)**. By taking morphisms—rather than isomorphisms—as the basic notion, DTT offers a directional perspective on types that aligns more closely with concepts from category theory and higher-dimensional algebra. This promises a unifying framework that bridges HoTT and (∞,1)-categories, potentially reshaping the theoretical underpinnings of both mathematics and computer science.

DTT opens the door to addressing several foundational questions:

- Parametricity and abstraction.
The univalence axiom reflects the abstractness of types, a key principle in both logic and computer science. However, as Reynolds observed, true abstraction also involves *parametricity*. We conjecture that a directed setting offers the right tools to reconcile univalence with parametricity, thereby deepening our understanding of abstraction in type theory.

- Core data type formers.
While HoTT provides many complex and expressive data types—such as multisets, real numbers, and type theory itself—it lacks a single type-former (analogous to the W-type for well-founded trees) that can uniformly express them. We believe DTT enables the formulation of such a unifying type-former, paving the way for a smaller and more principled core theory.

-Applications in quantum foundations.
Physicists exploring the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory and quantum gravity are increasingly turning to HoTT for formalisation. In this context, type theory components are reinterpreted in domain-specific ways, forming a framework for mechanised synthetic mathematics. We conjecture that DTT offers essential conceptual tools to handle directionality and non-reversibility inherent in these physical theories.

Our recent work has contributed to the emerging literature on DTT, but key questions remain open. This project will:

* Formulate DTT in a way that allows coherent interaction with traditional (symmetric) type theories,
* Develop the model-theoretic semantics of DTT, grounding it in category-theoretic and homotopical frameworks,
* Establish core metatheoretic properties, such as decidability of type checking and normalisation,
* Prototype an implementation demonstrating the practical feasibility of DTT as a foundation for computation and reasoning,
* Explore concrete applications, including those outlined above, and investigate connections with other frameworks, such as Higher Observational Type Theory (HOTT) and recent systems like Narya.

Methodologically, we will leverage existing proof assistants such as Agda, Lean or Rocq to formalise the metatheory, and we will build upon recent experimental platforms, notably Shulman's Narya, to guide and validate the implementation of DTT.

This research aims to lay the foundational groundwork for a new generation of type theories, offering both deep theoretical insights and a platform for practical formal reasoning in mathematics, computer science, and physics.
