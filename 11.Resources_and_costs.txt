Justification of Resources

This document provides a justification of the resources requested in
this proposal. Costs are grouped under staff, travel and subsistence,
workshops and open participation, and other directly incurred
costs. Estates and indirect costs are determined by the host
institutions and require no further justification. 

Staff

The largest component of the requested resources is staff time. We
request support for one full-time Research Associate (RA) for four
years. The RA will carry out the day-to-day research programme,
integrate the different strands of the project, and ensure continuity
across its duration. They will contribute both to the development of
new theoretical results and to their formalisation in proof
assistants, which is central to the proposal. The RA ensures sustained
and dedicated research time beyond that available to the investigators
and provides valuable training for an early-career researcher in a
strategically important area.

In addition, the budget requests 20% FTE for each of the three
Investigators (Thorsten, Ulrik, and Nicolai). The investigators will
undertake the bulk of the intellectual research. The work requires
expertise in both category theory and type theory, and progress relies
on sustained collaboration between researchers with complementary
strengths in these areas. In parallel, the investigators will
supervise and mentor the RA, ensuring that the RA’s contributions are
well integrated into the overarching research programme. They will
also devote time to coordinating with partners and disseminating
results to the community. The combination of substantial PI/Co-I input
and a dedicated RA ensures both the depth of investigator-led
innovation and the continuity and capacity needed for a project of
this scale.

Travel and Subsistence

We request travel and subsistence to enable collaboration,
dissemination, and community engagement. These activities are
essential to achieving scientific impact and keeping the project
internationally connected.

We budget for two structured hybrid meetings with collaborators: an
early planning meeting and a mid-project feedback meeting. These
ensure that the project benefits from external expertise and remains
aligned with both foundational and application-oriented goals. We also
request travel support for five key collaborators (£10,000), enabling
their direct contribution to shaping the project.
*** Why both, balance, flex for people further away

We further request funding for conference and workshop travel for the
core team. Each of the four team members will attend one major
international conference outside Europe (£3,000 est.) and three European
conferences over the project’s lifetime (£2,000 est. each), giving a total
of £36,000. These trips target leading venues — POPL, LICS, TYPES,
FSCD, CT, CSL, and HoTT/UF — which are the main fora for theoretical
computer science, type theory, and category theory. Participation
allows us to present results, obtain feedback from experts, and
maintain research networks.

We also include participation in the Agda Implementers’ Meetings
(AIM), which are essential community workshops for advancing
formalisation tools. We plan for four attendances over the lifetime of
the project, budgeted at £1,500 (.est) each (total £6,000). AIM provides
direct contact with developers and expert users of Agda, ensuring that
our formalisation work both benefits from and contributes to the state
of the art.

Workshops and Open Participation

We request resources to organise a dissemination workshop towards the
end of the project. This event will bring together project members,
collaborators, and the wider research community to consolidate
outcomes and explore future directions. We budget £9,000 in total:
this covers five external participants (speakers and early-career
researchers, at £1,500 each), plus catering (£700) and a conference
dinner (£800).

The workshop will provide a forum to present results to a broad
audience, support sustained discussion across type theory, category
theory, and formal verification, and encourage inclusivity. The budget
includes support for early-career researchers who might not otherwise
be able to attend, helping to strengthen the long-term vitality of the
community.

Other Directly Incurred Costs

We request only minimal support in this category, namely hybrid
participation facilities to allow collaborators to join meetings
remotely. No equipment is requested, as the host institutions provide
all necessary infrastructure.

Estates and Indirect Costs

These are calculated by the host institutions according to standard
methodologies and require no further justification.

Alignment with Vision

The requested resources are closely aligned with the project’s aims,
with each item contributing directly to the research programme.

The investigators’ time is central to the project. They will carry out
the bulk of the intellectual research, drawing on complementary
expertise in category theory and type theory. Their direct involvement
is essential: the project requires sustained collaboration between
senior researchers to develop definitions, prove results, and connect
theory with formalisation. The RA provides continuity and additional
capacity, but the originality of the work depends primarily on the
investigators’ contributions.

Travel resources support this investigator-led research by enabling
exchange of ideas with collaborators and peers. Meetings, conference
presentations, and participation in AIM ensure that the investigators’
results are tested, refined, and communicated in the international
research community, and that the formalisation aspects feed back into
tool development.  The dissemination workshop provides a
cost-effective way to consolidate outputs and extend their
influence. By engaging both established leaders and early-career
researchers, it strengthens the community around the themes of the
project.

Overall, the resources requested form a focused budget. They secure
the investigators’ active involvement while providing the support
needed to sustain progress, collaboration, and dissemination. The
project is designed to achieve its goals efficiently and inclusively,
with long-term value to the research community.
